        A blob of toothpaste is called a "nurdle." Hard to believe, isn't it? Look it up! <br>Does knowing that make your life
        better? Probably not, but did you know that Germans in the Middle Ages believed you could cure a
        toothache by kissing a donkey? Still not life-changing, but also, you're still reading. People are fascinated
        by interesting facts and the pursuit of truth. From the utterly useless to the laws underpinning our very
        reality, we love to learn about the world around us.<br><br>Here's another fact: this site works using APIs.
        This means that, although I have done my best to use good sources, I can't guarantee the appropriateness or
        correctness of all results. That said...<br><br>Explore the options below to learn about more
        cool stuff!
